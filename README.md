# Godot-Curbs
First game made in Godot - more of a minigame, actually. 
Project I made in collaboration with [nieczuje](https://github.com/nieczuje) in order to learn basics of Godot.

Play Store link: [Curbs minigame](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pl47studio.curbs&hl=pl) - currently there's only old version downloadable.
